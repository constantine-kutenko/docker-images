# FreeSWITCH docker image

## Overview

FreeSWITCH is designed to route and interconnect popular communication protocols using audio, video, text, or any other form
of media. First released in January 2006, FreeSWITCH has grown to become the worldâ€™s premier open source soft-switch
platform. This versatile platform is used to power voice, video, and chat communications on devices ranging from single calls on
a Raspberry Pi to large server clusters handling millions of calls. FreeSWITCH powers a number of commercial products
from start-ups to Carriers.

## Requirements

The image to be built and run requires docker - containerization platform. Check [upstream documentation](https://docs.docker.com/install) for how to install docker on your system.

```bash
docker build \
    --pull \
    --tag freeswitch \
    -f docker/Dockerfile .
```

To run the image use:

```bash
docker run \
    --rm \
    --name freeswitch \
    -e "FREESWITCH_CONFIG=freeswitch.xml" \
    -e "APP_ENV=development" \
    -e "CONFD_BACKEND=etcdv3" \
